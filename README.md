# Background and Purpose
A nonsense mutation, or premature stop mutation, is a change in the DNA sequence that causes a protein to terminate earlier than expected. This would result in a truncated and likely nonfunctional protein that can disrupt the normal regulation of an organism and lead to disease. Eukaryotes have a surveillance pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), that degrades mRNA transcripts with premature stop codons. However, a previous study has shown that mutant zebrafish induced with expected gene function-disrupting mutations had unexpected results, which escapes nonsense-mediated decay [Anderson et. al]. 

The purpose of this tool is to capture early stop-codons and predict a loss-of-function for the protein for the human genome.
