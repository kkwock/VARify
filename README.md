# Background and Purpose
A nonsense mutation, or premature stop mutation, is a change in the DNA sequence that causes a protein to terminate earlier than expected. This would result in a truncated protein that is likely unfunctional, which may disrupt the normal regulation of an organism and lead to disease. 

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic surveillance pathway that degrades mRNA transcripts with premature stop codons. However, a previous study has shown that mutant zebrafish induced with mutations expected to disrupt gene function, were able to escape nonsense-mediated decay [Anderson et. al]. 

The purpose of this tool is to capture early stop-codons and predict a loss-of-function for the protein for the human genome.
