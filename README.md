# Background and Purpose
A nonsense mutation, or premature stop mutation, is a change in the DNA sequence that causes a protein to terminate earlier than expected. This would result in a truncated, and likely nonfunctional protein that can disrupt the normal regulation of an organism and cause disease. To mitigate this issue, eukaryotes have nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a surveillance pathway that degrades mRNA transcripts with premature stop codons. However, in a previous study, mutant zebrafish induced with gene-disrupting mutations showed evidence of altered mRNA processing, meaning the transcripts have escaped NMD (2017, Anderson et. al). Translation of these  transcripts may result in wildtype or deleterious function.

The purpose of this tool is to capture early stop-codons and predict a loss-of-function for the protein for the human genome.
