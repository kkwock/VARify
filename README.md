# Background and Purpose
Genomic variants are a change in the DNA structure that affects a specific gene for a protein. While not all mutations can cause disease, there is the potential of a mutation altering a protein structure and function, which can disrupt the normal regulation and health of an organism. 

The purpose of this tool is to annotate and predict the function of a gene variant.
